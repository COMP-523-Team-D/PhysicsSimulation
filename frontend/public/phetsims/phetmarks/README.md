Bookmark URLs for use in PhET development

This is meant to be checked out as a sibling repository to the other PhET repositories, so that the relative URL
bookmarks will work. No server is necessary to use this, and anyone can create their own bookmark files.

# Root directory

phetmarks/ shows a raw-HTML list of bookmarks, that may be replaced in the future by an automatically-generated option

# phettest directory

HTML interface and Node.js server running on phettest.colorado.edu. Provides an interface to run simulations, pull repositories, see what is out-of-date, and build simulations.

# js directory

Used for the main phetmarks index.html.
