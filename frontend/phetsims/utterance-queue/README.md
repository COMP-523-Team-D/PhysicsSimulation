utterance-queue
=======================================================

Alerting queue and library powered by aria-live

### Documentation
This is under active prototyping, so please expect any sort of API to change. Comments at this stage are very welcome.

#### Dependencies

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used to build the source ("npm update -g grunt-cli", "npm update" and "grunt" at the top level
should build into build/). [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is required for this process.

Building source code requires the phetsims compiling repository: [chipper](http://github.com/phetsims/chipper/). Once 
dependencies are downloaded, source is compiled by running `grunt`.

This library also depends on [lodash](https://lodash.com/). You can find the current checked in dependency for this 
library in [sherpa](http://github.com/phetsims/sherpa/lib).

Currently, you can find the compiled library at [utterance-queue.min.js](http://phetsims.github.io/utterance-queue/build/utterance-queue.min.js) 
This is currently not versioned due to the accelerated development speed.


#### Hello World

(to be tested with a screen reader or your AT of choice)

```html
<script src="../sherpa/lib/lodash-4.17.4.js"></script>
<script src="../utterance-queue/build/utterance-queue.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const utteranceQueue = phet.utteranceQueue.UtteranceQueue.fromFactory();
  utteranceQueue.addToBack( 'hello world' );
</script>
```

`UtteranceQueue.fromFactory()` does a bit of setup work, and is a great place to start with the utterance-queue library.
If you want a bit more control you can setup like this:
```html
<html>
<body></body>
<script src="../sherpa/lib/lodash-4.17.4.js"></script>
<script src="../utterance-queue/build/utterance-queue.min.js"></script>
<script>

  const utteranceQueue = new phet.utteranceQueue.UtteranceQueue();

  const container = utteranceQueue.getAriaLiveContainer();

  // add the aria-live elements where ever is best
  document.body.appendChild( container );

  // step phet.axon.timer (in seconds) each frame. This takes care of UtteranceQueue's timing
  const step = ms => {
    phet.axon.timer.emit( ms / 1000 );    // time takes seconds
    window.requestAnimationFrame( step );
  };
  window.requestAnimationFrame( step );

  // Now you have a fully opperational UtteranceQueue.
  utteranceQueue.addToBack( 'hello world' );
</script>
</html>
```
