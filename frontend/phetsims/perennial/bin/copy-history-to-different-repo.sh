# Copies the history from one file/directory in one repo to another repo, using patches.
# Implementation based on the highest voted answer in
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1365541/how-to-move-files-from-one-git-repo-to-another-not-a-clone-preserving-history
#
# Usage:
# 1. cd into the directory of the source repository
# 2. copy-history-to-different-repo.sh FILE_OR_DIRECTORY DESTINATION_REPOSITORY
# 3. review the patch file to make sure nothing looks like trouble
# 4. move the file to the correct path in the destination repository
# 5. cd into the destination repository
# 6. git push
# 7. remove the patches/ directory
#
# Example:
# cd john-travoltage/
# copy-history-to-different-repo.sh js/SomeButtonFile.js ../sun
#
# If you run into problems, it may help to run interactively, comment out the "am" step below and run it manually
# git am --whitespace=fix --reject --interactive ../patches/griddle/js/bamboo/_patch.txt
