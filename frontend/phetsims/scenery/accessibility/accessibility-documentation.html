      <h1>Accessible Content in Scenery</h1>
    </div>

    <p>
      While some users can interact with an application through a graphical interface, many others rely on assistive technologies to read what is on screen.  For instance, a user might use a screen reader to navigate through elements on a screen and obtain information that others would observe visually.  The technical power of assistive technologies is growing rapidly, but it is still up to the developer to correctly instrument an application so that it is accessible to the user.
    </p>

    <p>
      For graphical rendering, PhET uses a custom scene graph for HTM5 called Scenery.  This can be used to display interactive graphics using canvas, SVG, and DOM.  Since SVG and canvas elements do not provide any outward information about their internal structure, assistive technologies have no way of reading what is inside.  The screen reader is only able to interpret the single canvas or SVG element.  Because of this, PhET simulations have been otherwise inaccessible to the assistive technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      PhET recently began to develop a method of making scene graph information accessible to screen readers so that educational simulations are available to as many users as possible.  It became clear that the accessibility implementation required two things.  First, the structure of the SVG and canvas elements needed to be publicly available to the assistive technology.  Second, this structure needed to be formatted in a way that the assistive technology could easily interpret the information using modern accessibility conventions.  The solution for PhET's accessibility meant that we needed to generate a structure that matched the scene graph with elements that could have custom accessibility information for the assistive technology.
    </p>

    <h2>The Parallel DOM</h2>

    <p>
      To accomplish this, we generated a parallel HTML structure that sits on top of the Scenery visual element.  Any visual node in the simulation can be represented in this parallel HTML DOM.  In this way, both the browser and assistive technologies have access to the the accessible representations of the elements on screen.  Since the DOM is written in HTML, any user can navigate to the various elements in the browser with a keyboard or assistive technology. This could include using 'tab' or any other keys that are handled by the screen reader that moves focus to various landmarks defined in the document.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Parallel DOM is generated dynamically on a node by node basis so that each visual element can have a customizable representative HTML element in the DOM structure.  This allows us to have full control over the HTML elements and their associated attributes for accessibility.  Assistive technologies can easily interpret the parallel DOM according to modern HTML accessibility conventions.
    </p>

    <h2>Example Accessibility Tree</h2>

    <p>
      The following is what the parallel DOM might look like for a single screen of a PhET simulation.  This is the prototype for accessible content of the Net Force screen of PhET's Forces and Motion: Basics simulation.
    </p>

    <pre class="brush: html">
    &lt;!-- Accessibility HTML for the Net Force screen of FAMB --&gt;
    &lt;div aria-labelledby='netForceLabel'&gt;

      &lt;!-- Title and description for the whole screen --&gt;
      &lt;h2 id='netForceLabel' aria-describedby='netForceDescription'&gt;Net Force&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p id='netForceDescription'&gt;
        There is a heavily loaded cart on wheels sitting on a track...
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;!-- Left puller group.  A button is used to enter the nest so that the user can quickly navigate to this element and understand that using the button will begin a drag and drop mode. --&gt;
      &lt;input tabindex="0" type='button' value='Left pullers' aria-labelledby="leftPullerGroupDescription" id="leftPullerGroupButton"&gt;
      &lt;p id="leftPullerGroupDescription"&gt;Left pullers standing near rope.  Press enter to select a puller for drag and drop.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;ul id="leftPullerGroup" hidden&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" draggable="true" aria-grabbed="false"&gt;Left group, Large puller standing near rope&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" draggable="true" aria-grabbed="false"&gt;Left group, medium puller standing near rope&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" draggable="true" aria-grabbed="false"&gt;Left group, first small puller standing near rope&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" draggable="true" aria-grabbed="false"&gt;Left group, second small puller standing near rope&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;!-- Right puller group.  A button is used to enter the nest so that the user can quickly navigate to this element and understand that using the button will begin a drag and drop mode. --&gt;
      &lt;input tabindex="0" type='button' value='Right pullers' aria-labelledby="rightPullerGroupDescription" id="rightPullerGroupDescription"&gt;
      &lt;p id="rightPullerGroupDescription"&gt;Right pullers standing near rope.  Press enter to select a puller for drag and drop.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;ul id="rightPullerGroup" hidden&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" draggable="true" aria-grabbed="false"&gt;Right group, Large puller standing near rope&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" draggable="true" aria-grabbed="false"&gt;Right group, medium puller standing near rope&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" draggable="true" aria-grabbed="false"&gt;Right group, first small puller standing near rope&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" draggable="true" aria-grabbed="false"&gt;Right group, second small puller standing near rope&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;!-- List of knots along the left side of the rope, using the aria-dropeffect to signify that these are potential locations for a puller --&gt;
      &lt;h4 id="leftKnotGroupDescription" hidden&gt;Left knots.  Press enter to place selected puller on knot.&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;ul tabindex="0" id="leftKnotGroup" aria-labelledby='leftKnotGroupDescription' hidden&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" aria-dropeffect="move"&gt;First knot, closest to the cart&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" aria-dropeffect="move"&gt;Second knot&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" aria-dropeffect="move"&gt;Third knot&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" aria-dropeffect="move"&gt;Fourth knot, farthest from the cart&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;!-- List of knots along the right side of the rope, using the aria-dropeffect to signify that these are potential locations for a puller --&gt;
      &lt;h4 id="rightKnotDescription" hidden&gt;Right knots.  Press enter to place selected puller on knot.&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;ul tabindex="0" id="rightKnotGroup" aria-labelledby='rightKnotDescription' hidden&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" aria-dropeffect="move"&gt;First knot, closest to the cart&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li tabindex="0" aria-dropeffect="move"&gt;Third knot&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li tabindex="0" aria-dropeffect="move"&gt;Fourth knot, farthest from the cart&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;!-- GO button with auditory description --&gt;
      &lt;input tabindex="0" type='button' value='Go' aria-disabled='true' aria-describedby='goButtonDescription'&gt;
      &lt;p id='goButtonDescription'&gt;Select to start pullers&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;!-- PAUSE button with auditory description --&gt;
      &lt;input tabindex="0" type='button' value='Pause' aria-disabled='true' aria-describedby='pauseButtonDescription'&gt;
      &lt;p id='pauseButtonDescription'&gt;Select to pause pullers&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;!-- Accessible visibility checkboxes, nested in a fieldset for some accessibility benefit in legend announcement and implicit arrow key navigation --&gt;
      &lt;fieldset&gt;
        &lt;legend&gt;Visibility Controls&lt;/legend&gt;
        &lt;input type='checkbox' id='sumOfForcesCheckbox'&gt;
        &lt;label for='sumOfForcesCheckbox'&gt;Sum of Forces&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;input type='checkbox' id='valuesCheckbox'&gt;
        &lt;label for='valuesCheckbox'&gt;Values&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;/fieldset&gt;

      &lt;!-- Accessible reset all button with an auditory description --&gt;
      &lt;input type='reset' value='Reset all' aria-describedby='resetAllDescription'&gt;
      &lt;p id='resetAllDescription'&gt;Select to reset screen&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;!-- Accessible TOGGLE SOUND button with an auditory description --&gt;
      &lt;input type='button' value='Toggle sound' aria-describedby='toggleSoundDescription'&gt;
      &lt;p id='toggleSoundDescription'&gt;Select to toggle sound&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;!--Element used to alert the user that an action or event has occured in the simulation--&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="ariaActionElement" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;/div&gt;

    </pre>

    <p>
      Note that the above example is a snapshot of the parallel DOM.  Scripting in the simulation code changes the various DOM element attributes so that the HTML document continues to represent the dynamic simulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The example above illustrates that the parallel DOM is composed of standard HTML elements that represent Scenery nodes.  For instance, groups of pullers for a game of tug-of-war are represented by list elements inside of an unordered list.  Buttons are represented by input elements of type button.
    </p>

    <p>
      The above example also exemplifies accessibility information for a rich internet application content in a PhET simulation using WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Interactive-Accessible Rich Internet Applications).  Take for instance a puller and a knot in the above example.  In the simulation, a drag and drop interface is used to place a puller on a knot position on the rope for a game of tug-of-war.  While the developer is responsible for defining the drag and drop behavior in the sim JavaScript code, WAI-ARIA attributes can be used to let the user know that drag and drop is defined in the interface.  For instance one of the pullers has the following DOM representation:
    </p>

    <pre class="brush: html">
      &lt;li tabindex="0" draggable="true" aria-grabbed="false"&gt;Right group, first small puller standing near rope&lt;/li&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
      The 'Draggable' attribute lets the user know that the element has a defined drag and drop behavior.  The 'aria-grabbed' attribute further lets the user know that the element has not yet been selected for dragging.  For example, NVDA will read the above element as:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>“Left group, Large puller standing near rope draggable one of four”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, each knot position on the rope has an aria attribute that describes the operation that should occur when the puller is released from dragging.
    </p>

    <pre class="brush: html">
      &lt;li tabindex="0" aria-dropeffect="move"&gt;First knot, closest to the cart&lt;/li&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
      A screen reader such as NVDA will read the above list item as:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>“ First knot, closest to the cart drop target one of four”</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Creating Accessible Content for Scenery Nodes</h2>

    <p>
      Each element in the above example is dynamically generated by view code.  Since the scene graph provides a parent child relationship for the visual elements, Scenery is able to structure the Parallel DOM based on the hierarchical structure that is already present within the scene graph.  While rendering the visual content, Scenery is also assembling the separate HTML for accessibility which sits on top of the SVG and canvas visual elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following example requires some background knowledge of JavaScript and Scenery.  If you are just getting started with development using Scenery, please see <a href=http://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/>PhET's Scenery Documentation</a> for more information on creating visual elements for the display.
    </p>

    <h3>Example Accessibility Javascript</h3>
    <p>
      The following block of code illustrates how such accessibility code might be defined in a PhET simulation.
    </p>

    <div id="example-accessibleContent" class="exampleScene" style="width: 0px; height: 0px; margin: 0 auto;"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      docExample( 'example-accessibleContent', function( scene, display ) {
        /*START*/
        var sceneryNode = new scenery.Node()

        // outfit for accessibility
        sceneryNode.setAccessibleContent( {
          createPeer: function( accessibleInstance ) {

            /* Element should look like the following in the accessibility tree:
             * <li tabindex="0" draggable="true" aria-grabbed="false" class='Puller' id='uniqueValue'>Left group, Large puller standing near rope</li>
             */
            var domElement = document.createElement( 'li' );
            domElement.tabIndex = '0';
            domElement.draggable = true;
            domElement.setAttribute( 'aria-grabbed', 'false' );
            domElement.className = 'Puller';
            domElement.id = pullerNode.accessiblePullerId; // unique ID for element lookup in DOM

            // Translatable description for 'Left group, large puller standing near rope'
            domElement.innerText = accessibleDescription;

            domElement.addEventListener( 'keydown', function( event ) {
              // ...
            } );
          }
        } );
        /*END*/
      } );
    </script>

    <p>
      As shown in the above code example, the accessible content is added to the node through the setAccessibleContent function.  The function takes an object which wraps around a createPeer function of an AccessibleInstance.  This object structure is the boilerplate needed by scenery to implement the hierarchy structure of the DOM.  Inside the createPeer function, we can see the standard ways of dynamically creating DOM elements and setting various attributes with JavaScript.  In addition, an example of adding an event listener to the element is shown.  Further scripting could be added here to implement behavior for the keydown event.
    </p>

    <h3>Setting the navigation order</h3>

    <p>
      A set of nodes can also have a specified focus order. This defines the order of navigation for a group of nodes. If not provided, the default focus order is the rendering order defined in the parent node's children array.  The following is an example of how the accessible order can be defined for the children of a parent node.  While navigating with an assistive technology, exampleChild2 will receive focus before exampleChild1.
    </p>

    <div id="example-accessibleOrder" class="exampleScene" style="width: 0px; height: 0px; margin: 0 auto;"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      docExample( 'example-accessibleOrder', function( scene, display ) {
        /*START*/
        var exampleChild1 = new scenery.Circle( 0, 10, 15 );
        var exampleChild2 = new scenery.Circle( 20, 10, 15 );
        var exampleParent = new scenery.Rectangle( 0, 0, 64, 64, {
          accessibleOrder: [ exampleChild2, exampleChild1 ]
        } );

        exampleParent.children = [ exampleChild1, exampleChild2 ];
        scene.addChild( exampleParent );
        /*END*/
      } );
    </script>

    <h3>Custom Focus Highlights</h3>

    <p>
      In addition, to setting attributes of the accessible HTML element, one can also create custom focus highlights for a Scenery node. This is set through an optional key called 'focusHighlight', for the object passed into setAccessibleContent. This focus highlight can be any custom Scenery Node or Shape. If no focus highlight is passed into the node's accessibleContent, the default highlight is a pink-ish rectangle that is defined by the node's bounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following is an example of setting a rectangular node's focus highlight to a circular shape.
    </p>

    <div id="example-focusHighlight" class="exampleScene" style="width: 128px; height: 128px; margin: 0 auto;"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      docExample( 'example-focusHighlight', function( scene, display ) {
        /*START*/
        var exampleRectangle = new scenery.Rectangle( 32, 32, 32, 32, { fill: 'red' } );
        exampleRectangle.setAccessibleContent( {
            // Specify shape for the focus highlight.
            focusHighlight: kite.Shape.circle( 48, 48, 32 ),

            // create the accessible peer in the parallel DOM
            createPeer: function( accessibleInstance ) {
              // The element in the parallel DOM will look like:
              // <input type="button">Rectangle Button</input>
              var domElement = document.createElement( 'input' );
              domElement.type = 'button';
              domElement.value = 'Rectangle Button';

              // Add an event listener to the dom element which listens to a button press.
              domElement.addEventListener( 'click', function() {
                exampleRectangle.fill = exampleRectangle.fill === 'red' ? 'blue' : 'red';
              } );

              return new scenery.AccessiblePeer( accessibleInstance, domElement );
            }
          } );
        scene.addChild( exampleRectangle );
        display.updateOnRequestAnimationFrame();
        /*END*/
      } );
    </script>

    <h2>Remaining Questions for Accessible Content</h2>

    <p>
      Implementing the parallel accessibility HTML has been successful in that we are able to generate the DOM and use it to provide assistive technologies with an interface for information.  However, there are still many challenges and questions that we face with this implementation.  Accessibility HTML behaves very differently across platforms.  Getting accessible content to behave predictably across PhET's supported platforms will be one of the largest immediate challenges.  Initial tests of the Parallel DOM show that browsers and assistive technologies interpret accessible content vastly differently. ARIA is still hot off the press, and some browsers do not fully support ARIA events yet.  Many combinations of browsers and screen readers do not seem to handle ARIA events correctly yet.  We are hopeful that using native HTML without WAI-ARIA when possible will produce more predictable accessibility behavior.  Browsers are also developing their accessibility so that they work well with WAI-ARIA, so it is possible that accessible HTML will behave more predictably as accessibility continues to develop browser side.
    </p>

    <p>
      The accessibility DOM is a document representation of a fully dynamic application. Much of the accessible information about PhET simulations will be in headings, landmarks, and paragraphs.  Rather than directing and designing the navigation of the simulation through custom controls, it will be up to the user to 'know' that information is accessible in the various DOM elements.  They will need to use their assistive technogy to explore the content on their own as they would any other HTML document.  It is unclear at this time whether all users will understand to approach the simulation as a standard HTML document, and not as an interface of complex elements that are emulating a desktop application.
    </p>

    <h2>Previous Implementations</h2>

    <p>
      PhET has considered other methods of adding accessible content to interactive simulations besides the Parallel DOM.  The parallel DOM approach was chosen primarily because it was easiest to implement and maintain.  The first implementation that was considered used ARIA enhanced SVG markup with the canvas sub-DOM structure.  The canvas sub-DOM and SVG markup are unrelated accessibility layers.  On top, the SVG layer maintained SVG-specific accessibility features.  On the bottom was the canvas, with accessibility related sub-DOM peers that were kept under the canvas element.  With this approach, accessibility features would be supported by SVG in some browsers, and by canvas in others.  The SVG and canvas support would be totally unrelated, and we would have to do at least double the work to implement and maintain both SVG and canvas layers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Comparatively, the Parallel DOM approach allows us to avoid the complexity in a simplified structure.  In this case, we have visual SVG on top, the Canvas layer on the bottom, and a parallel DOM tree that handles all accessibility on the side.  There is no need to use a mixed method of SVG with Canvas sub-DOM structure for implementing accessibility.  The display is entirely separate from the accessibility and we do not need to maintain accessible content in multiple layers.  Similarly, the parallel DOM represents visual elements with mostly native HTML.  We have a method of exposing the internals of the SVG and Cavas elements, so we can generate standard HTML for these input controls using W3C standards for accessible content.  Keyborad navigation and accessibility should behave well and be handled by PhET's supported browsers.
