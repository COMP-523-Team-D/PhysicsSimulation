/**
 * Stitcher that only rebuilds the parts necessary, and attempts greedy block matching as an optimization.
 *
 * Given a list of change intervals, our greedy stitcher breaks it down into 'sub-blocks' consisting of
 * drawables that are 'internal' to the change interval that all have the same renderer, and handles the
 * glue/unglue/matching situations in a greedy way by always using the first possible (allowing only one sweep
 * instead of multiple ones over the drawable linked list for this process).
 *
 * Conceptually, we break down drawables into groups that are 'internal' to each change interval (inside, not
 * including the un-changed ends), and 'external' (that are not internal to any intervals).
 *
 * For each interval, we first make sure that the next 'external' group of drawables has the proper blocks (for
 * instance, this can change with a glue/unglue operation, with processEdgeCases), then proceed to break the 'internal'
 * drawables into sub-blocks and process those with processSubBlock.
 *
 * Our stitcher has a list of blocks noted as 'reusable' that we use for two purposes:
 *   1. So that we can shift blocks to where they are needed, instead of removing (e.g.) an SVG block and
 *      creating another.
 *   2. So that blocks that are unused at the end of our stitch can be removed, and marked for disposal.
 * At the start of the stitch, we mark completely 'internal' blocks as reusable, so they can be shifted around as
 * necessary (used in a greedy way which may not be optimal). It's also possible during later phases for blocks that
 * also contain 'external' drawables to be marked as reusable, due to glue cases where before we needed multiple
 * blocks and now we only need one.
 *
 * We also use a linked-list of blocks during stitch operations (that then re-builds an array of blocks on any changes
 * after all stitching is done) for simplicity, and to avoid O(n^2) cases that would result from having to look up
 * indices in the block array during stitching.
 *
 * NOTE: Stitcher instances may be reused many times, even with different backbones. It should always release any
 * object references that it held after usage.
